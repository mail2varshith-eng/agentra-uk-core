# Agentra.ai Core – MVP Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the **Agentra.ai Core MVP (v0.1)**.

---

## 🧠 High-Level Flow

1. User provides a **goal** (text input).
2. `Agent` sends the goal to the **Planner**.
3. **Planner** breaks it into **tasks**.
4. **Agent** loops through tasks:
   - Chooses a tool (e.g., mock web search)
   - Executes the task
   - Logs the result
5. Agent combines results and sends to **Summariser**.
6. Output is shown to the user.
7. Full session is saved to `/logs`.
