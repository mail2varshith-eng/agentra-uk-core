# Agentra.uk – Version 0.2 Development Roadmap

Version 0.2 represents the transition from a deterministic MVP to a semi-autonomous,
tool-connected agent system with foundational memory, workflow management,
and preparation for multi-agent collaboration.

---

## 1. New Tools (Tool Layer Expansion)
To move beyond mock tools, v0.2 introduces real-world integrations:

- Email Sending Tool (SMTP / API-based)
- Calendar Tool (Google Calendar / Outlook API)
- Web Scraper Tool (Requests + BeautifulSoup)
- API Fetcher Tool (Generic HTTP Client)
- Local File Writer Tool (secure disk operations)

These tools will enable the agent to execute tasks that produce real outcomes.

---

## 2. Memory Layer (memory/)
The initial memory engine will support:

### **Short-Term Context Memory**
- Store intermediate reasoning steps
- Save tool outputs between tasks
- Give the agent temporary awareness during execution

### **Long-Term Memory (Future – v0.3+)**
- Vector-based semantic recall (FAISS / sentence-transformers)
- Memory pruning strategies
- Agent persona persistence
- Knowledge graph links (v1.0+)

---

## 3. Recovery & Safety Mechanisms
To make the agent more reliable, v0.2 introduces:

- Automatic retries for failed tool calls  
- Structured error handling  
- Fallback logic for web failures  
- Logging of all errors into `/logs`  
- Safe mode for unknown failures  

This prepares the system for real-world consistency.

---

## 4. Planning & Reasoning Enhancements
The planner module will evolve with:

- Micro-step reasoning logs  
- Task-state tracking  
- More accurate goal interpretation  
- Planning heuristics for tool selection  
- Pre-/post-conditions for tasks  

This strengthens the agent’s autonomy and decision-making quality.

---

## 5. Workflow Execution (workflows/)
The workflow system will allow:

- Execution of multiple tasks as a pipeline  
- Passing outputs from one step to the next  
- Managing branching decisions (v0.3)  
- Future multi-agent workflows (v1.0)  

This is essential for real business use cases.

---

## 6. Testing Framework (tests/)
To ensure stability:

- `test_planner.py` — validate planning logic  
- `test_agent_execution.py` — simulate full agent runs  
- `test_tool_integrations.py` — verify new tools  
- `test_memory_engine.py` — validate memory operations  

This establishes engineering maturity and reliability.

---

## 7. v0.2 Development Goal
Version 0.2 prepares Agentra.uk to move beyond a demo and become a modular,
tool-enabled, learning-ready autonomous agent system.

It sets the foundation for:
- v0.3 intelligent memory  
- v1.0 multi-agent collaboration  
- v2.0 workflow dashboard  
- v3.0 fully autonomous work execution

---

## 8. Status
🚀 **v0.2 development: IN PROGRESS**  
This version will be built openly and published publicly as part of Agentra.uk's roadmap.
