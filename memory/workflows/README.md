# Workflows Module (v0.2)

The `workflows` module introduces the foundation for multi-step automated
workflow execution within Agentra.uk.

## Purpose
Workflows will allow the agent to:
- Execute sequences of tasks
- Pass outputs between steps
- Handle branching logic (future)
- Manage complex autonomous routines

## Current State (v0.2)
This version includes:
- `WorkflowManager` placeholder implementation
- Basic execution handler for future task pipelines

## Future Enhancements (v0.3+)
- Workflow definitions in JSON/YAML
- Dynamic step routing and branching
- Error recovery & retry strategies
- Multi-agent coordinated workflows
- Scheduler for background autonomous processes
