# Memory Module (v0.2)

The `memory` module introduces the initial foundation for Agentra.uk’s 
short-term and future long-term memory systems.

## Purpose
The memory layer will help the agent:
- Store intermediate reasoning steps
- Maintain context across multi-step tasks
- Recall previous tool outputs
- Build the foundation for persistent long-term memory (future release)

## Current State (v0.2)
This version includes:
- `MemoryEngine` placeholder implementation
- Temporary in-memory context storage
- Basic add/recall operations

## Future Enhancements (v0.3+)
- Persistent memory (file or database-backed)
- Vector embeddings for semantic recall
- Memory pruning strategies
- Multi-agent shared memory space
